Renchu Miao (NYU Student, undergraduate, junior)

Goals / Needs



1\. Have a more comprehensive profile page where, after filling in details such as major and past course history, the system can automatically recommend suitable courses and professors.



2\. Include a course discussion forum, not just reviews, so students can ask questions and exchange experiences in depth.



3\. Reduce advertising and simplify the interface — avoid distracting or dynamic ads that may cause misclicks or slow down the site.



4\. Provide a more complete professor database — allow students to add missing professors so that all instructors can be found in the system.



Problems / Frustrations



1\. Current platforms do not provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual students.



2\. Some courses have only two or three reviews, which is not sufficient to evaluate them effectively; students wish for more reviews or peer discussion spaces.



3\. Too many ads, making the page laggy and sometimes leading to accidental clicks.



4\. Some professors are missing (marked as N/A), making it difficult to find useful information.

## User Requirements



1\. As a student, I want to have a comprehensive profile page that uses my major and course history to recommend classes and professors, so that I can make better enrollment decisions efficiently.



2\. As a student, I want each course to have a discussion forum, so that I can go beyond reviews and actively interact with peers taking the same class.



3\. As a student, I want the platform to have fewer ads and a cleaner design, so that my browsing experience is smooth and not interrupted by unnecessary distractions.



4\. As a student, I want the course database to be more complete, and to have the ability for students to submit application of adding missing courses, so that information stays up-to-date and inclusive.
