## Stakeholders

### Stakeholder 1: Diana Pujals (NYU Student, Undergraduate, Junior)

- **Goals / Needs**

1.  Filter professors by teaching style (group projects, lecture heavy, discussion-based, etc)
2.  See professors' background details (degrees, years of experience, reasons for choosing the profession, etc)
3.  Get matched with a professor based on chosen criteria.
4.  Have one place to see classes and professors with reviews simultaneously

- **Problems / Frustrations**

1.  No way to filter by teaching style on current platforms.
2.  There is no transparency on the professors' qualifications and teaching motivations.
3.  It is time consuming and confusing to switch among from one professor rating to another.
4.  Difficult to keep track checking multiple systems (Albert, external review pages).

### Stakeholder 2: Liam Tang ( NYU Student, Undergrad, Senior)

- **Goals / Needs**:

1. See ratings from students and what courses the professor is responsible for

2. Understand the workload and time commitment needed for the course in a week

3. Weight different ratings based on how much they have used the app in the past and how much others agree with the student’s review

4. Have up-to-date information and make sure that current professors are listed

- **Problems / Frustrations**

1. information is not updated frequently if a professor joins or leaves a university for another university

2. Too many pop-up ads so it’s annoying to interact with the website

4) You can’t look at the average rating of professors by the courses they teach but only as an average compiled by all of the courses they teach, so you should be able to filter. As they might teach an easy and hard course

### Stakeholder 3: Renchu Miao (NYU Student, Undergraduate, Junior)

- **Goals / Needs**

1. Have a more comprehensive profile page where, after filling in details such as major and past course history, the system can automatically recommend suitable courses and professors.

2. Include a course discussion forum, not just reviews, so students can ask questions and exchange experiences in depth.

3. Reduce advertising and simplify the interface — avoid distracting or dynamic ads that may cause misclicks or slow down the site.

4. Provide a more complete professor database — allow students to add missing professors so that all instructors can be found in the system.

- **Problems / Frustrations**

1. Current platforms do not provide personalized recommendations tailored to individual students.

2. Some courses have only two or three reviews, which is not sufficient to evaluate them effectively; students wish for more reviews or peer discussion spaces.

3. Too many ads, making the page laggy and sometimes leading to accidental clicks.

4. Some professors are missing (marked as N/A), making it difficult to find useful information.

5. You can’t look at the average rating of professors by the courses they teach but only as an average compiled by all of the courses they teach, so you should be able to filter. As they might teach an easy and hard course

### Stakeholder 4: Ming Jia (NYU Student, Second-year Graduate, Teaching Assistant)

- **Goals / Needs**

1. See which professors have strong reputations for mentoring graduate students.

2. Understand whether professors are approachable for office hours and research discussions.

3. Find reviews that highlight teaching clarity for both undergrad and grad-level courses.

4. Have a reliable place to compare workload expectations between grad seminars and undergrad lectures.

- **Problems / Frustrations**

1. Current review platforms focus mostly on undergrad classes, not graduate-level teaching.

2. Hard to know if a professor is supportive of research collaboration or mentoring.

3. Graduate course feedback is scattered, sometimes not available at all.

4. No centralized system to see how the same professor teaches at different levels.

## Product Vision Statement

Our mission is to provide a safe forum to share classroom experiences to help NYU students make critical education choices

## User Requirements

1. As a student, I want to be able to look at reviews of professors and what courses they teach, so I can understand what material I am registering to learn.

2. As a student, I want to be able to understand how much time I will be committing to a course, so I manage my time well.

3. As a student, I want to be able to filter out good/bad reviews of students, so I get reliable information.

4. As a student, I want up-to-date information of professors, as they might have switched universities and teach different courses, so the same professor is not listed multiple times or I get confused when reading reviews of people with the same name.

5. As a student, I want to filter professors by teaching style, so that I can match my learning preference.

6. As a student, I want to see a professor's background, so that I can evaluate their credibility and expertise before enrolling.

7. As a student, I want to get professor recommendations automatically, so that I can find a good match in my field of study without spending too much time going through profiles.

8) As a student, I want to see class information and the professor's rating in one place, so that I don't loose track switching between multiple pages or systems.

9) As a student, I want to have a comprehensive profile page that uses my major and course history to recommend classes and professors, so that I can make better enrollment decisions efficiently.

10) As a student, I want each course to have a discussion forum, so that I can go beyond reviews and actively interact with peers taking the same class.

11) As a student, I want the platform to have fewer ads and a cleaner design, so that my browsing experience is smooth and not interrupted by unnecessary distractions.

12) As a student, I want the professor database to be more complete, and to have the ability for students to submit application of adding missing professors, so that information stays up-to-date and inclusive.

13) As a graduate student, I want to see reviews that mention research mentoring, so that I can choose professors who support my academic growth.

14) As a graduate student, I want to check whether professors are approachable during office hours, so that I know if I’ll have opportunities to ask questions and seek guidance.

15) As a graduate student, I want to filter reviews by course level (undergraduate vs. graduate), so that I can focus on feedback that’s relevant to me.
